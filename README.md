# Balaam Bot
Another Discord bot of biblical proportions.

[![Coverage Status](https://coveralls.io/repos/github/wildjames/BalaamBot/badge.svg?branch=main)](https://coveralls.io/github/wildjames/BalaamBot?branch=main)

# TODO: Write a README

I got the soundbites from [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1dr2XcAQAuCPJqZQkCRKa4Aq8IDOH8ZIz)

## Setting up a bot

Follow the instructions [here](https://discordpy.readthedocs.io/en/stable/discord.html). If it helps, this is the [Discord applications page](https://discord.com/developers/applications) which will house your bot settings in the future.

## Required bot permissions

Set the bot to install only to Guilds - not to users. There are no features that would work for individuals I think.

Scopes:
 - `applications.commands`
 - `bot`

Permissions:
 - `Connect`
 - `Send Messages`
 - `Speak`
 - `Use Voice Activity`
 - `View Channels`

Privileged Intents:
 - `Message Content Intent`

# Future Work
See [TODO.md](TODO.md) for a list of things to do.
